/**

 *
 * - After defining regions or other entities the adapter may call event
     functions. Most prominent are the region enter (SCOREP_EnterRegion()) and
     exit (SCOREP_ExitRegion()) functions which trigger the callpath handling,
     the metrics calculation and the trace writing. The user is responsible for
     proper nesting, i.e. that a higher level region can't be exited before
     all child regions are exited.

 * - The main difference between VampirTrace and Scalasca regarding the event
     interface is the timestamping. Where Scalasca takes the timestamp in the
     measurement system, VampirTrace requires every adapter to do this.

 * - The Scalasca way currently introduces some overhead if additional timings
     are done on events that are logically at once. Prominent examples are
     MPI_Send/Recv where the MPI adapter obtain a timestamp on esd_enter and
     on esd_mpi_send although the are logically at once. It turns out that
     this extra timestamp isn't really necessary for Scalasca's analysis
     (maybe it was at some time). So we will improve the implementation and do
     the timestamping inside the measurement system.
