 * allocated memory of a specific type. Due to the usual memory access
 * patterns during measurement this design is hopefully justified.
 *
 * We provide specific functions for different types of memory (like summary,
 * definitions, etc.) instead of a generic interface (that accepts e.g. a enum
 * to specify the type) to be more flexible and performant during
 * implementation (e.g. the summary needs a multithreaded implementation
 * whereas the definition memory is per process).
 *
 * We do not provide a memory interface for otf2 as it may not be possible to
 * harmonize the parameters for the paged allocator.
