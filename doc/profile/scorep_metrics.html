<h2>Score-P metrics</h2>

<a name="time"><h3>Time</h3></a>
<dl>
<dt><b>Description:</b></dt>
<dd>
    Total time spent for program execution including the idle times of CPUs
    reserved for slave threads during OpenMP sequential execution. This
    pattern assumes that every thread of a process allocated a separate CPU
    during the entire runtime of the process.
</dd>
<dt><b>Unit:</b></dt>
<dd>Seconds</dd>
<dt><b>Diagnosis:</b></dt>
<dd>
    Expand the call tree to identify important callpaths and routines where
    most time is spent, and examine the times for each process or thread to
    locate load imbalance.
</dd>
</dl>

<a name="visits"><h3>Visits</h3></a>
<dl>
<dt><b>Description:</b></dt>
<dd>
    Number of times a call path has been visited. Visit counts for MPI routine
    call paths directly relate to the number of MPI communications and
    synchronizations. Visit counts for OpenMP operations and parallel regions
    (loops) directly relate to the number of times they were executed.
    Routines which were not instrumented, or were filtered during measurement,
    do not appear on recorded call paths. Similarly, routines are not shown if
    the compiler optimizer successfully in-lined them prior to automatic
    instrumentation.
</dd>
<dt><b>Unit:</b></dt>
<dd>Counts</dd>
<dt><b>Diagnosis:</b></dt>
<dd>
    Call paths that are frequently visited (and thereby have high exclusive
    Visit counts) can be expected to have an important role in application
    execution performance (e.g., <a href="#time">Time</a>). Very frequently
    executed routines, which are relatively short and quick to execute, may
    have an adverse impact on measurement quality. This can be due to
    instrumentation preventing in-lining and other compiler optimizations
    and/or overheads associated with measurement such as reading timers and
    hardware counters on routine entry and exit. When such routines consist
    solely of local/sequential computation (i.e., neither communication nor
    synchronization), they should be eliminated to improve the quality of the
    parallel measurement and analysis. One approach is to specify the names of
    such routines in a <em>filter</em> file for subsequent measurements to
    ignore, and thereby considerably reduce their measurement impact.
    Alternatively, <em>selective instrumentation</em> can be employed to
    entirely avoid instrumenting such routines and thereby remove all
    measurement impact. In both cases, uninstrumented and filtered routines
    will not appear in the measurement and analysis, much as if they had been
    "in-lined" into their calling routine.
