Usage: scorep-score <profile> [options]
Options:
 -r          Show all regions.
 -h, --help  Show this help and exit.
 -f <filter> Shows the result with the filter applied.
 -c <num>    Specifies the number of hardware counters that shall be measured.
             By default, this value is 0, which means that only a timestamp
             is measured on each event. If you plan to record hardware counters
             specify the number of hardware counters. Otherwise, scorep-score
             may underestimate the required space.
 -m          Prints mangled region names instead of demangled names.
